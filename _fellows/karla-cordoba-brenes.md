Karla Córdoba-Brenes has a vision of the world in which communities with a shared purpose can create digital currencies based on self-determined values and rules. Using blockchain technology, Karla and the [BeSpiral](https://bespiral.com/) team will create an open platform allowing any group to introduce new currencies for achieving socio and environmental goals.

In a world where almost everyone is constrained by central banks, Karla’s idea to spread and unify the premise of localised currencies is bold, innovative and exciting. Studies on complementary currencies have revealed many positive impacts on local environments, economies and societies. This idea is potentially transformative for communities - particularly those that lack resources.

We believe Karla’s work could add real value to local economies, everywhere, by allowing the community to determine what is value in the first place. We look forward to learning from the community-driven, currency-based social experiments that will be enabled and inspired by Karla and the BeSpiral platform. 

Karla’s work focuses on: 

- Promoting a different vision of the Blockchain and cryptocurrencies as forces for good
- Creating open platforms, tools and resources for communities to create and launch complementary currencies quickly and easily
- Helping communities define their own, value-based rules on the nature of money
