Adam Hyde would like to see scientific research results benefit a far wider audience through current, accessible and replicable dissemination. At present, it can take months - sometimes years - for publishers to create and process scientific research manuscripts, due to unwieldy toolsets and archaic, inflexible practices.

Adam is building the necessary platforms, methodologies and communities to establish open source collaborative knowledge production and publication as part of the academic process.

{% contentfor funding %}
Open access journal publishing is a good start to making scientific output more accessible. We support Adam as his work goes a step further by providing an improved set of approaches and tools to record and share the research process along with the findings.

Adamâ€™s work focuses on: 

- Increasing the value of scientific output to benefit wider society
- Providing practical solutions to real world problems felt by academics, researchers, administrators, funders and publishers
- Re-imagining the scholarly communication process
