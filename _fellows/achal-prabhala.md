Medicines save lives. Unfortunately the right to profit often overrides the right to access. Fake innovation, manifested in bad patents, harms humanity: it blocks affordable versions of life-saving drugs and impedes real innovation. Too often, the cost of bad intellectual property is the price of life.

Achal Prabhala is determined to change this. As a thoughtful and strategic advocate for intellectual property reform and access to medicines, Achal challenges the legal and policy frameworks that underpin the global development and manufacture of medicines in order to improve access and innovation. 

{% contentfor funding %}
The Foundation has supported many projects and initiatives to increase access to knowledge, but this could be the most important. Achal has the potential to reset the default on innovation in healthcare, ensure affordable access to life-saving medicines, and put in place - and protect - better, fairer patent laws.

Achalâ€™s project focuses on: 

- Instituting higher patent standards
- Defending existing pro-access initiatives against onslaughts from private interests
- Extending their global reach, especially within India, South Africa and Brazil
