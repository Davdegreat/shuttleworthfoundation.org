We are pausing applications until then to fully capture the outputs and outcomes of the fellowship programme to date and to explore potential new themes we want to support, as reflected in [Fellowship forward](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2018/10/26/thinking-fellowship-forward/). We will also seek out communities we have not yet reached.  

We invite potential applicants to take the time to reflect on the future you would like to see, and then focus your idea on the contribution you think you can make. Think beyond how we might better deliver on the systems we have, to how we might fundamentally build better systems, at any level. 

We are specifically looking for ideas in areas we have not yet invested in or not invested in multiple times. Openness remains a key component.
